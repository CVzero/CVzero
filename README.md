# CVzero
Making computer vision simple for everyone!

CVzero is a python based library that aims to simplify computer vision for the purpose of robotics and use with the Raspberry Pi. We are working towards two main modes (One for tracking coloured objects and one for learning the object into a database for detection) although we have plans to include more features in the future.

The end goal is to achieve a seamless computer vision library which replicates results of dedicated colour detection hardware, with easy to use functions and a reliable tracking and training mode.

Required packages:
OpenCV Version 3 (and above) , 
NumPy
