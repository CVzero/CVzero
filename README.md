# CVzero
### Making computer vision simple for everyone!

CVzero is a Python 3 library that aims to simplify computer vision for the Raspberry Pi* robotics.
As well as the library, a companion App for the Raspberry Pi is being developed for selecting an object and displaying its colour signature. It will be possible to save the colour signatures collected as a file for the library to use.

The CVzero library requires that OpenCV and its dependencies are installed.

*The library may be able to be used with other platforms but has not been tested or guaranteed to work.

## Building

This code builds using setuptools. We strongly suggest you use a virtual environment, and then use 
```python setup.py develop``` - this will symlink into your python installation such that any changes
you make to the code here will be immediately reflected in the libraries imported by scripts without
having to install again.
